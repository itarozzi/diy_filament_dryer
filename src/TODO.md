# DEV TODO LIST

-[ ] set label timer color when enabled and running
-[p] timer countdown (at the moment using eez-flow... need to be tested)
-[x] stop regulation when timer expired and reset initial values
-[ ] assign Disabled flag of labelTime (as momentary workaround I use Hidden flag with same expression)
